- Everything you do should be aligned with your goal
- It is easy to lose sight of your goal and focus on things that you think make you more productive while not achieving any actual progress toward your goal

The goal of any business: "Make money"

## Things that are not actual goals, but rather mean to achieve the goal
- Buying primary resources (labor or material) at the lowest possible price.
	- Can lead getting things that do not meet our requirements (labor is not skilled enough, material are inadequate or delivered too late, etc.)
- Hiring competent people
	- Can lead to getting someone who is over qualified, too expensive or create delay in production because hiring process is too long.
- Using the latest technology
	- Can lead to dependency on rare expertise
	- Can increase cost
	- Can create delay because few of the employee are experts
	- Can lead to bottleneck that is harder to expand
- Build products
	- Can lead to over-production and high storage cost
	- Unsold product represent money that is locked and can't be use for anything else
- Build high quality product
	- Can lead to situation where the quality of the product exceeds the need from the demand
	- Make the product too expensive to produce, which lead to lower profit or cost of production high than what the customer is willing to pay for the product.
- Making employees work
	- There is no difference between an employee sitting and doing nothing and an employee working on a task that does not ultimately help the business make money.
- etc. (Customer Satisfaction, marketing)

## Basic Indicators
- Net benefit: Money made - Money spent
- Relative benefit: Money made / Money spent
	- Making 100k in profit means nothing if you spent 10million (1% return)
	- Goal should be to achieve better return than investing
- Liquidity / treasury: Money reserve used to pay expenses
	- A business will become bankrupted at any moment where its liquidity is insufficient to pay its cost for a month. This is regardless if the year is positive overall

While it is possible to play around with the number to make one indicator look good at the detriment of the others, your goal should require that ALL of them be raising all constantly. 

## Theory of Constraint Indicators
1. **Throughput**: This is the rate at which the system generates money through sales. It is not merely production or output rate, but specifically money coming into the business from selling the goods or services it produces. Throughput is calculated as the revenues generated from sales minus the totally variable costs (costs that vary directly with the volume of production, such as raw materials).

2. **Inventory (Stocks)**: In TOC, Inventory refers to the money that the system has invested in purchasing things which it intends to sell. This includes raw materials, work-in-progress (WIP), and finished goods. Inventory is viewed as a liability rather than an asset because it ties up cash that could otherwise be used elsewhere in the system.

3. **Operating Expense**: This is the money the system spends in order to turn inventory into throughput. Operating Expenses include all costs other than totally variable costs, such as utilities, salaries, depreciation, and maintenance. These are essentially the fixed costs of running the business.

Trying to change any of these indicators will most likely affect at least one other. Also note that added value generated by work is not taken into account.

## Applied to my department 

1. **Throughput**: The rate at which the team completes and deploys fixes and new features that contribute directly to the company's operations or revenue. This could be measured by the number of tasks or updates completed that enhance user experience, reduce downtime, or add revenue-generating features to the website.

2. **Inventory (in this context, Work-in-Progress)**: All the pending requests and tasks—both fixes and new features—that are queued for development but not yet completed. These can be seen as the "stock" held by the team. In TOC, minimizing inventory is crucial as it represents tied-up resources that are not yet delivering value.
 
3. **Operating Expense**: This would be the costs associated with running your support and maintenance division. It includes salaries of the developers, manager, director, and QA specialist, as well as any tools or software licenses required to perform the work. These are the expenses the division incurs to turn the inventory (pending requests and tasks) into throughput (completed and deployed tasks).

## The impact of co-variance (dependency events + random fluctuation)
If you place people in file and make them walk, over time gaps will grow between the walkers. This is because anything that make someone slow down (insect in eye) will create a everyone behind that person slow down has well and widen the gap. While anything that speed(caffeine kicking in) up someone will be limited due to being incapable of going faster than the one before them.

In this situation the distance between first and last walker is the Stock, the walking speed of the slowest walker represent the through put and the operating expenses is the energy expended by the walkers.
 
Same thing with a simulation where bean are pass from one player to the next using dice rolls. 

Positive capacity is limited because of dependency
Negative capacity is unlimited.

## Processus de progres permanent

Process is a sequence (read chain) of steps
Not just a bunch of improvement (reflection before and after)

80/20 Pareto Principle

The throughput is like the resistance of a chain only the weakest link matters

## Theory of constrain

**1. Identify the Constraint**: First, determine what restricts your division’s ability to process tasks more quickly. It might be the number of developers, the QA process, unclear specifications from the web-department, or perhaps technical debt in the website’s code.

**2. Exploit the Constraint**: Once the constraint is identified, make sure it’s working as efficiently as possible. For example, if the QA process is a bottleneck, ensure that the QA specialist has the tools and support needed to work as effectively as possible, perhaps by automating parts of the testing process.

**3. Subordinate Everything Else to the Decision**: Align the whole team’s efforts to support the efficient functioning of the constraint. For instance, if developer capacity is the constraint, other team members (like the manager or director) might take on more preparatory work like clarifying requirements or coordinating with the web-department to ensure developers can focus on coding.

**4. Elevate the Constraint**: If the constraint cannot be adequately managed by the first three steps, consider ways to permanently increase capacity or efficiency at this point. This could involve hiring another developer, investing in better development tools, or providing additional training to current staff.

**5. Repeat the Process**: TOC is an ongoing process. Once the current constraint is addressed, evaluate the system again to find the next constraint and begin the process anew.

## Mental process of a manager
1. "What needs to change"
2. "What the change needs to be (end result)"
3. "How to provoke the change"

- How to find fundamental problem in complex systems?
- How to create and verify solution to those problem, making sure they don't comeback or create new ones
- How to provoke the needed change without resistance

## Epilogue

### What are the barriers to applying the knowledge of the theory of constraint
1. Incapacity to propagate the message in the whole enterprise: too complex to explain quickly and not everyone wants to read.
2. Incapacity to translate the theory into actionable task (missing systemic process)
3. Incapacity to convince decision makers of the need to change the performance indicators

### 5 level of resistance
1. Problem come from somewhere else (bad client, bad employees, syndicate, etc.)
2. This is not gonna solve the problem
3. Too inconvenient
4. We are not capable to do this
5. People are not gonna accept it 

## Ideas 
- Team based bonuses instead of individual ones
- Uncouple remuneration from performance indicators
- Team performance review
- When you need to shrink favor waiting for people to leave by themselves and do not re-hire
- Pad of printouts of conflict resolution diagram to fill in for each case 

## Catalyst for change 
- Pressure to improve
- Awareness that doing more of the same will not solve the problem
- Guidance in taking the first step

## Drum-Buffer-Rope (DBR) 
- Drum: is the constraint that sets the pace for the entire system.
- Buffer: protects the drum, ensuring it always has work lined up.
- Rope: the synchronization mechanism that ensures that the system does not process work too quickly, preventing inventory pile-up.
